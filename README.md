# AI Video Scripts

This project is a web-based tool for generating AI videos. It provides a step-by-step workflow to create videos, including:

- **Prompt Generation**: Create and refine prompts for the AI.
- **Storyboarding**: Visualize the video scenes and structure.
- **Composition**: Assemble and edit the video components.
- **Preview**: Review the final generated video.

The application is built with Vue.js, Vite, and uses Element Plus for the UI components.
